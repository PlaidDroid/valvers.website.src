  <h1 class="display-4">Denford Orac Lathe</h1>
  <p class="lead">With some money that my Grandma and Grandad left me, I bought a Denford Orac CNC lathe.</p>
  <hr class="my-4">
  <p> It's an ex-school machine that was mainly used to turn engineering platics. It's turned out to be brilliant - I love it. After it working under it's own steam for a while I started converting it and upgrading the motor drivers, etc. to run more modern CNC control software.
