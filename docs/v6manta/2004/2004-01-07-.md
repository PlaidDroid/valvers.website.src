Many thanks for your comments. I've heard comments before about these fire extinguishers not working, but also heard that Halon is no longer permitted? I'll just have to do what I can if the dreaded ever happens... :(

Good point about the battery box too, hadn't thought of that one!

Hopefully when I come back off holiday the car will start taking shape :)
