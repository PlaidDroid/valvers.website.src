hmmm, that's an interesting setup Yeha! Thanks for that.

Doesn't look like a manta subframe at all though. Even how it mounts to the chassis seems to be different ( no bad thing I guess! lol )

My fuel pressure gauge arrived today for the manta. Looks cool. Just waiting for the fuel hose + fittings to arrive now, and then I can get on with routing that lot through the car. Not many free weekends coming up though :(
