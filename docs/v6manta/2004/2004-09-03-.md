Right, I popped the fuel lines in around about where I think they'll end up going. The spaces are filling up quick. I can't take it down the passenger side of the tunnel, as the vertical handbrake will be taking up a lot of room around there. Still, I reckon they're probably ok where they are positioned now. The gear shifter principle works fine, I just need to machine something up properly now. The billets for that arrived earlier last week.

Coming along, slowly but surely. The harness bar is only tacked in place at the moment, and the rear diagonal is out of place at the mo too ;)
