A few more pics. One of the door frames is done to accept a perspex window, and the passenger seat is now mounted. I am going to mount the drivers seat on rails too, as putting it slightly higher up allows me to get the seat closer in towards the tunnel, which then clears my head better from the cage. I can tilt the seat back a bit to move my head down too.
