I cannot get an accurate enough reading with the old calipers. I've chucked them in the head that's here. I'll get Lee to bring his dial gauge around on Saturday and whilst eating a McD's breakfast we'll measure the lift and duration.

The guy that sold them is very honest, and the engine came out of a Darrian tarmac rally car, which was sold to them by SBD :) So it's likely that everything is cool and dandy! :D
