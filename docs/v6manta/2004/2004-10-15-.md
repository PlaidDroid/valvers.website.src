Rob, I'd be bored if I had nothing to make!   Mine will be vertical, on the drivers side of the tunnel I reckon, depends where everything wants to be when the gearsticks done...

Christian, Here you can compete in rallying, even with a fully customised space-framed car if you can get it approved. I forget which class I would be in with the 20XE in the Manta, but it's a fairly standard class, nothing too major. I'm also not too fussed about being competitive to begin with, I just want to go and scare Animal, who'll be in the passenger seat!     8)
