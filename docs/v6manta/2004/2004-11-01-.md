As I forgot a load of the -6JIC fittings that I was meant to get from my last order, I have got hold of some more. I managed to find that Nick Skidmore on racecar had a load for sale at a good price, and got the last stock that he had.

Here they are:

Hopefully now I have enough fittings to do everything. This way I can -6 the fuel pumps, and rails, etc. They were well priced because they have been used. But then again, these are re-usable fittings!
