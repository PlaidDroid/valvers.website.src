Well, I have started stitch welding the underside, and I am continuing to remove the underseal and general surface rust and crud from the underside of the Manta. It's looking a bit more purposeful at the back end now. It's quite a slow process, but it's actually quite easy to do.

One thing I have noticed, is how much my welding has improved from when I started this project. Which incidently was around 2 years ago or something ridiculous! It's good to have renewed enthusiasm for it, and to see it getting closer to the road.
