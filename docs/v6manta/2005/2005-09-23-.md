It's not all bad news. Most of this manta chassis is in very good nick, and certainly compared to a lot, it's in pretty good condition. As I remember it, my nova which would have been about 3 years younger than this car, was a lot more rotten underneath. 

Actually, and on top, inside and outside! lol

I've nearly finished cleaning off all the underseal from underneath on one half of the car. I'll probably turn it over the other way to do the lower half. Just have to move all the stuff I'm temporarily storing in the manta first before I can turn it back over!!
