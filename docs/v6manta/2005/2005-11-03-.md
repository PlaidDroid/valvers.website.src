I am now also modifying the subframe arms too:

Once this is all finished, the front subframe should be very strong. I'm hoping that the sump guard that I make should keep everything in check too, as I want it to bolt to the subframe, and to the subframe arms. This should add a lot of strength to this part. Which reminds me to get some 10mm thick ali plate to make the sump guard with!
