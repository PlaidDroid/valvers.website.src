# 2007-11-13 - 2007-11-13 Getting it ready to paint...
Last weekend, Lee and I popped down to the bodyshop to order the paint for the Manta. So now that's on order, and being picked up this week it's time to get on with prepping the shell. The manta is back on the spit again and the underside is the first part to get all the crud removed.

With all the rubbish out of the way, the shell will be treated to some Kurust where appropriate, and then I have a good two pack etch primer to chuck at it, before some white paint hits it.

The outside of the shell will be orange, and the rest will be white. Oh, with some decent matte black spraying on a few bits.

Here is the manta back on the spit again, courtesy of Lee's phone :)
