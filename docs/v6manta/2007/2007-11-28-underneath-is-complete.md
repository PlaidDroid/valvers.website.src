# 2007-11-28 - 2007-11-28 Underneath is complete!
Yep, the underneath of the car is complete. Chucked on two coats of etch Zinc primer, and then four bottles of Gravi-Tex on top of that. The Gravi-Tex stuff was recommended and I have to say, it's great stuff. So now the underside is white, I'll need to get the inside and engine bay finished off in white, and then move on to the outer bits of the shell which will need to have a decent finish.

Want it to look good the first time it goes into a tree! ;-)

The devillbiss gun has been a star so far. I can't wait to see what sort of finish we can get from the gun on the orange bits!
