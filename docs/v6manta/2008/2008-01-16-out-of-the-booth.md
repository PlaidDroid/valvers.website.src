We dropped the tarpaulin's last night and took the last of the masking off to see the whole shell. It's looking great!

Now that those bits are complete, I have to do the rest of the bolt-on panels in orange, and I also have to paint the cage and front bulkhead in a very matte black. I want to use Nextel (or an equivalent) so I'll have to see if I can get hold of some. Once the cage and bulkhead are painted, I can start bolting stuff in and doing the fuel and brake lines as well as the wiring. It shouldn't be too long before I am just concentrating on the engine build.
