# 2008-03-15 - 2008-03-15 Front Suspension Build
The front suspension is now built up. It's very satisfying building a car when all the ball joints and bearings are new. Everything feels tight and good.

I still have to build up the rear diff with some new bearings, but after that I really need to look at getting hold of the wheels and tyres so that I can get the car as a rolling chassis.
