# 2008-09-04 - 2008-09-04 Some More Headwork
I have done some more work to the V6 heads. Well, I have virtually finished the inlet ports of the first head! Hopefully at the weekend I'll have all the inlets done on both heads and perhaps one of the exhaust ports sorted out. Then it'll be onto the chambers.
