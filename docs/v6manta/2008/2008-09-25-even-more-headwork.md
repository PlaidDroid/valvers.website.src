# 2008-09-25 - 2008-09-25 Even More Headwork
I have now virtually completed one of the heads. I'm not happy with how the chambers have come out, but hey, it's only my first V6 head, and it's a mild tune so nothing too much to worry about. I'll be better equipped when I decide to build a higher spec V6 in the future.

The exhaust ports have been opened out to remove the EGR lump, which normally impedes gas flow a lot. I haven't bothered welding up the dip that is left in the port as the flow loss caused by it is minimal.

Some further photos of the head are shown below:
