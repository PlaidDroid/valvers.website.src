# 2009-10-05 - 2009-10-05 Trialling the throttle bodies + a few more bits painted
Sorry, haven't written up any updates for ages. Been a bit busy with the mill and the lathe but I've also been doing some bits on the Manta.

I've sprayed the front bumper, bonnet and doors. I haven't chucked the doors on yet. I did try the throttle bodies in place though as soon as they arrived! :)

and obviously I popped the bonnet + bumper in place.
