# 2010-02-01 - 2010-02-01 Exhaust Manifolds
I've ordered all the tubes + bends I think I'll need to make the exhaust manifolds for the V6 in the manta. But, I need to order the manifold flanges.

Previously I designed some manifold flanges to suit 1 3/4&quot; primaries. However, having consulted the book Four Stroke Performance tuning and going through some sums it looks like I need to go a bit smaller on the primaries. The American company that I ordered the tube through does 1 5/8&quot; tubing and that works out pretty much spot on, so I ordered stainless tubing, mandrel bends and collectors in that size. The collectors are 3:1 and 1 5/8&quot; inlets and 2&quot; outlet.

So, I need to work out the external circumference of the tube + make this the circumference of the holes in the exhaust flange (Plus some clearance!)

The od of the tube is:

                <div style='width:90%'>
                    <table cellpadding='0' cellspacing='0' style='width:100%;border:0px'>
                        
                            <td class='photo_tl'>
                            <td class='photo_t'>
                            <td class='photo_tr'>
                        
                            <td class='photo_l'>
                            <td align='left' class='photo_m' style='padding:2px'><tt>1 5/8&quot; * Pi = (1.625 * 25.4) * Pi = 129.7mm</tt>
                            <td class='photo_r'>
                        
                            <td class='photo_bl'>
                            <td class='photo_b'>
                            <td class='photo_br'>
                        
                    
                

The current cutouts in the exhaust flange are obrounds with a radius of 15mm and an external horizontal measurement of 55.5mm. Thus the circumference of that cutout is:

                <div style='width:90%'>
                    <table cellpadding='0' cellspacing='0' style='width:100%;border:0px'>
                        
                            <td class='photo_tl'>
                            <td class='photo_t'>
                            <td class='photo_tr'>
                        
                            <td class='photo_l'>
                            <td align='left' class='photo_m' style='padding:2px'><tt>((15 * 2) * Pi) + ((55.5-30) * 2) = 94.25 + 51 = 145.25mm </tt>
                            <td class='photo_r'>
                        
                            <td class='photo_bl'>
                            <td class='photo_b'>
                            <td class='photo_br'>
                        
                    
                
(I never remember the order of precedence for operations so I've just parenthesised it well)

I need a couple of mm of clearance, but not 15mm! So I will instead use an obround with an overall horizontal dim of 50mm and a radius of 13.75mm

                <div style='width:90%'>
                    <table cellpadding='0' cellspacing='0' style='width:100%;border:0px'>
                        
                            <td class='photo_tl'>
                            <td class='photo_t'>
                            <td class='photo_tr'>
                        
                            <td class='photo_l'>
                            <td align='left' class='photo_m' style='padding:2px'><tt>((13.75 * 2) * Pi) + ((50-27.5) * 2) = 86.4 + 45 = 131.4mm</tt>
                            <td class='photo_r'>
                        
                            <td class='photo_bl'>
                            <td class='photo_b'>
                            <td class='photo_br'>
                        
                    
                
I've uploaded a quick reference drawing of the design. I should upload a DXF too as this makes life a lot easier. It's too complex to fully dimension the PDF!
