# 2010-02-03 - 2010-02-03 Ordered the Exhaust Manifold Flanges
Picked up a cam belt so that I can bolt the heads on and fit the cams + do the timing. Also got to do the important part - painting the block! lol

Exhaust manifold flanges are on order. I'm getting them made out of 8mm 304L Stainless. They aren't exactly cheap, but as the rest of the kit is stainless, it makes sense to make the whole lot out of stainless.
