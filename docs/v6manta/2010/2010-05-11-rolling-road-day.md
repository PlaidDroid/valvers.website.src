# 2010-05-11 - 2010-05-11 Rolling Road Day!
At the Rolling Road Day I only took a couple of photo's because it was such a busy day (Fixing things! lol)

It was fun, and I guess it went as well as expected with a few things to fix, one of which couldn't be repaired at the RR. So now I am jumping in Lee's nova to get to Germany and am looking forward to a rest, some good food and having a laugh in Germany instead of driving the Manta. It's a shame, but the Manta is nearly ready for the road now, all it needs is a few things being fixed and tested to make it reliable and then it can go back to the RR for a final mapping session.

Once that is done, I can get it to some track days to see how well it goes! Can't wait! :D
