# 2010-06-01 - 2010-06-01 Sumps off
Righty, got up the garage and got the engine off the subframe and whipped the sump off. Where it is leaking is basically where the weld has not sealed, it's actually pretty obviously looking closely with the sump off!!

So the sump's cleaned up and ready to seal up. I'll also change the scavenge pump pick-up pipes to vacuum rated pipe instead of standard stuff, and modify the subframe a bit. There is a good bit of heat protection and manifold wrapping to do too. It can all probably be done in a weekend. Then I just want to modify the bulkhead to give better clearance when inserting and removing the engine; It will help a lot.

Soon be back on the road hopefully. Can't wait to start it up again!
