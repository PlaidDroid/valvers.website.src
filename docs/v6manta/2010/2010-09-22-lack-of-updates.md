# 2010-09-22 - 2010-09-22 Lack of updates
Sorry for the lack of updates! I've just been really busy attempting to get the manta ready for a trip to the ring.

In the end, the Manta didn't make it as the engine got through two sets of big end bearings before I managed to get it mapped! So I had to borrow a mates track day car to go and do Spa and the Nurburgring.

What an awesome holiday that was! Absolutely amazing, Spa is a brilliant track, Eau Rouge, Pouon, and Bruxell's are brilliant corners. The TV always makes these tracks look so easy, but they are extremely challenging. Really enjoyed this trip.

So hopefully soon, the Manta will be up and running again. It ran for a bit and I went up and down the lane by the garage a few times to make sure it worked! ;)
