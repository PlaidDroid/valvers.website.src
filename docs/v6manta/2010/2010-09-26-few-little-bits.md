# 2010-09-26 - 2010-09-26 Few little bits
Didn't really do much this weekend, apart from have a tidy up, recover from going to Spa + the Ring and having an awesome bbq!

Bored out the -12 oil return fitting, which had a big reduction in it. Here's a comparison of the bored out one, and the original:

A big difference!

Also a big difference is the -12 inlet to the pump instead of the -10 inlet:

The only other thing I did was make some new spacers for the oil pump to get a little bit more belt tension, and to make the pump sit parallel. Also to use the lathe which I haven't used in a while! ;) It's better than jacking the car up and getting oily changing the big ends again, which is what I really need to do next.
