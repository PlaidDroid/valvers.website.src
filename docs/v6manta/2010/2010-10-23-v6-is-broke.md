# 2010-10-23 - 2010-10-23 V6 is broke
Pah! The engine is broke, boooo! So now it's back out for diagnosis. The original oil starvation must've damaged more than just the big ends. I have a feeling the first main is fubar and is blocking the oil supply to the first big end. I'll just build another fresh engine...
