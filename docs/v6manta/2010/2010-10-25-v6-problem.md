# 2010-10-25 - 2010-10-25 V6 problem
Well, the problem is pretty terminal <B>and</B> obvious!

Yep, the rod cap is totally out of round! The original damage is quite bad. Pretty good bit of damage for oil starvation. The heads look OK though, so that really is a bonus. The engine is completely stripped now and so hopefully I'll manage to get a replacement for the weekend. Need to make a phone call tomorrow and hopefully I can arrange to pick it up at the weekend.

Glad to have found an obvious problem after all this faffing around though. I guess the oil stat problem I found was the reason for the original oil failure, so hopefully I can bolt something back together that is going to have a good chance of working! lol
