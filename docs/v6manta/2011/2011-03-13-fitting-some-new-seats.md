# 2011-03-13 - 2011-03-13 Fitting some new seats!
Got some new Corbeau Revolution seats now that I'm getting ready for strutineering. Turned out that it's a bit of a pain to fit them right, but I want to make sure the MSA regs were going to bite me in the ass, so I made sure all the dimensions and mountings were suitable for scrutineering.

Only done the drivers side so far, will spend this week finishing off the passenger side!

There is something like 100mm between the top of my crash hat and the top of the roll cage tube, so that will easily pass MSA regs :)

Before, with the old Magnum seat, it never felt like I was going to pass that test, and anyway - it just felt plain wrong!
