# 2011-09-14 - 2011-09-14 Started work on the new sump pan
I started milling down a new sump pan to replace the old dry sump pan, which always leaked! This time around I am thinking of making the scavenge channel out of solid ali and machining it out. The previous pan was made of folded ali and was never really the right size. Both scavenge fittings leaked in the old pan - no matter how much sealant I used!
