# 2011-09-15 - 2011-09-15 More subframe work
Did some more:

Tested it again in the engine bay. Next I'm going to have to sort the engine bay out and put the engine back in to be able to do any more work on this frame. I was looking at it, thinking "I'm sure the oil pump is meant to be there..., and I'm sure the alternator should be there along with the front pulley!". So chances are it'll need modifying quite a lot when I have the engine in place! lmao Doh!
