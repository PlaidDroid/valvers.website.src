# 2011-09-17 - 2011-09-17 Gearbox back together
I should have been painting the engine bay, but I couldn't be arsed to go up the garage and do the messy work, so instead I'll just put the engine and box back in without painting to enable me to finish off the frame and mounting of everything and then take it back out to finish everything off and re-do the sump.So today I put the gearbox back together properly and put the now-flat bellhousing back on along with the clutch release bearing.

So tomorrow I'll try and get the clutch on, and the engine and box back in place to finish re-mounting everything.
