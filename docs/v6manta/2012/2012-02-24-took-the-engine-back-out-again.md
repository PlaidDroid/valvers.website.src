# 2012-02-24 - Took the engine back out again!
Whilst trying to get the last bolt in the engine mounts and wondering why everything was a bit too solid to let me get it in, I noticed that the new JIC hose on the sump was interfering with the subframe:

So I had to remove the engine again to modify the subframe to clear the hose. But at least it'll give me the chance to re-wrap the exhaust manifolds properly before I put it in again at the weekend.
