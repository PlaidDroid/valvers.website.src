# 2012-04-16 - Ready for a test drive
The Manta is once again ready for a test drive. Everything is together and working okay. No oil leaks, and nothing getting too smokey. I warmed it up with some fresh petrol to check everything and waited for the cooling fan to kick in. Everything seems perfect, so hopefully that's how it'll drive! :D

Broom, Broom! :-D

<strong>EDIT:</strong>

Chris, The coolant system is using a [Davies Craig EWP115](https://www.daviescraig.com.au/Electric_Water_Pumps-EWP115__12V____DIGITAL_CONTROLLER__Combo_Pack____PART_No__8030-details.aspx) electric water pump. The coolant system is arranged as below. I will get a few photos for you in the next post. Thanks for your interest!
