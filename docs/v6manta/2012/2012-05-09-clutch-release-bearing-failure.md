# 2012-05-09 - Clutch Release Bearing Failure
Well, really user error! I've never put a stop on the clutch pedal to limit the throw of the hydraulic release bearing, and now it's come to bite me in the ass! The bearing over-stroked and was crooked in it's bore and so was very tight. It couldn't be moved by hand at all!

Oh well. Had to take it apart to find out that this had happened, and the bearing piston was solid in its bore! *Sigh* - Won't be going to Germany in it in a few weeks now! :(
