# 2012-10-13 - Rebuilt The Gearbox
So, finally got the last of the bits needed and the time needed to rebuild the gearbox! After ages of tinkering with the gearset to try and shoehorn it into the case, it turned out a misaligned sleeve meant the gears were around 3-4mm spread out, resulting in it not going in!

So now it's back together and shimmed up, hopefully it won't make god awful noises in 5th gear!
