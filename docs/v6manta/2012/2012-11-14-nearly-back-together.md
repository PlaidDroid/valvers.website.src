# 2012-11-14 - Nearly back together
Nearly finished putting the Manta back together last night. Just the prop, exhaust and a few hose clips + electrical connections to do and then we're ready to go for a test drive again! Woohoo! :D

Had to repair a hose that I damaged when removing the engine! It's best to always remember when hoses wrap around the subframe so that you at undo one end before trying to pull the engine out!

Luckily the damaged hose was more than long enough to suffer the lost length. That's certainly not true for any other hose on the oil system!
