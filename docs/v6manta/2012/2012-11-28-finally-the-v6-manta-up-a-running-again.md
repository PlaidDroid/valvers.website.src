# 2012-11-28 - Finally the V6 Manta up a running again!
After what seems like an eternity I have the V6 manta up and running again! Thank the lord for that! It's taken ages to get back on the road again. This time hopefully we'll keep it on the road for more than a few miles and manage to do a few trackdays in it! That would be nice tbh!

Here's a quick proof video, that it does run! (Nothing more though, don't get too excited! lol)

..and here's a few photos of how it's looking with the brake ducts now fitted too:
