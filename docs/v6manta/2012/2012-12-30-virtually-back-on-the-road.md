# 2012-12-30 - Virtually back on the road
The manta is now practically back on the road. I just need to sort out the dash now. Two tiny jobs to do - remount the oil pump in the right place as it's slightly on the wonk and re-connect the steering column at the correct angle! The dash then needs re-fitting and then there's a lot of tidying up to do, but only after it has an MOT.

I made a clutch stop to stop me from over-stroking the clutch. It's a pretty simple, but adjustable affair that I simply welded in place on the bulkhead - a bit of white paint will make it look like a bit of a better job tbh!
