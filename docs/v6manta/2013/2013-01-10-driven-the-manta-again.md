# 2013-01-10 - Driven the Manta again!
Finally I got to have a blast in the Manta! It didn't fall apart or break, or anything!

Anyway, here's a quick vid which shows just one thing:

I need to sort out the headlights! They are and always have been bloody awful. So, I got myself on eBay and bought a H4-3 35W dual xenon Hi/Lo HID set. They are cheaper than a set of good standard H4 bulbs. I suppose we'll have to wait and see if they are any good though. For £30 it's worth a punt.

While I'm at it, I could do with getting some LED lights for the rest of the car:

Front Sidelights and Side Repeaters - Bosch 233 Fitting: BA9s (4W)

Indicator lights - Bosch 382 (Also know as type 1156) Fitting: BA15s (21W)

Rear stop/Brake lights - Bosch 380 (Also known as type 1157) Fitting: BAY15d  (21W/5W)

There's one slight oil leak to fix at the oil filter and the rest looks A-Okay. Will be good to get some more information on the dash too so that it's easier to keep an eye on what's going on - oh and getting the speedo to work too would be nice!
