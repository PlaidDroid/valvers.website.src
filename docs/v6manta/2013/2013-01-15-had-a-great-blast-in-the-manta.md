# 2013-01-15 - Had a great blast in the Manta
Finally the day came where I could have a good blast in the Manta. We tooled up with camera's and started her up. That was such a fun morning! Nice to get up the garage, blast around in the car and have some fun and then head home without having to do anything messy or annoying! :D WooHoo!

Nothing fell off or blew up either, so that's a bonus! The first video is my favourite, I'm guessing we'll remember that day for a long time as it was just so much fun!
